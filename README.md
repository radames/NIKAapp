## About

Waged labour planned economy promises control over time by raising efficiency.                                               

Unlike the emperor dressed in nothing, time is nothing dressed in clothes.

At the beginning of the 1920s, proletarian settlers in Vienna developed a planned economy of housing typologies. These were discussed with lantern slides, projected by architect [Margarete Lihotzky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarete_Sch%C3%BCtte-Lihotzky).
There are libraries of tools to dress up time – and turn offices into living space. 	

In Frankfurt am Main vacant offices amount to more than two million square metres of unused urban space - this is equal to the total amount of living space provided by one of the city’s larger districts. Applicate Against Time repurposes these commercially created tools for new social contexts. [NIKA.haus](https://nika.haus/en) is a syndicate project which will prove that the transformation of offices into living space for solidary and non-commercial housing is a realistic alternative.
